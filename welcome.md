Streaming media have been seeing massive year over year growth in terms of consumption hours recently. For many people, streaming services have become part of everyday life and accessing and consuming media content via streaming is now the norm for people of all ages. Powered by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, streaming services are becoming one the most visible and impactful applications of ML that directly interact with people and influence their lives.

Despite the rapid growth of streaming services, the research discussions around GenAI for streaming media remain fragmented across different conferences and workshops. Also, the gap between academic research and constraints and requirements in industry limits the broader impact of many contributions from academia. Therefore, we believe that there is an urgent need to:
1. Build connections and bridge the gap by bringing together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry working on these problems
2. Attract more GenAI and ML researchers from other areas to streaming media problems
3. Bring up the pain points and implementation challenges in industry to which academia researchers can pay more attention to

With this motivation in mind, we are organizing a workshop on Generative AI for Streaming Media (GenAI4SM) in conjunction with the WSDM 2026. We invite quality research contributions, including original research, preliminary research results, and proposals for new work, to be submitted. All submitted papers will be peer reviewed by the program committee and judged for their relevance to the workshop, especially to the topics identified below, and their potential to generate discussion. Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop and will be published in the companion (workshop) proceedings of the WSDM 2026. We welcome research that has been previously published or is under review elsewhere. Such articles should be clearly identified at the time of submission and will not be published in the proceedings.
